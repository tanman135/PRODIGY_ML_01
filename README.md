# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Objective
This project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  
- **Features Used**:
  - Square footage (`GrLivArea`)  
  - Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)  
  - Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)  
- **Target**: House price (`SalePrice`)  

## Steps
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train a Linear Regression model using the selected features.
3. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
4. Predict house prices based on user input.

## Results
- MSE: 2,806,426,667.25
- Predicts house prices effectively based on given inputs.
